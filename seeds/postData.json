    "comment": "I cant believe it costs $140 for the SoundBlast 4F!  It is noisy, probably far more than a laptop that is equipped with the same processor. The fact that the fan dynamically spins faster or slower depending on the load means that a constant whir, which can almost fade in the background as white noise, is out of question.  Awful Quality!",

    "comment": "The new cases from CaseCompany are really sleek! From the side, the Predator G6 looks like a giant black and silver square with one pointed angle jutting out in front. The rear of the case takes on a snake head-like appearance with its maw open to reveal backside ports. The top rear edge also acts as a carry handle, which you'll feel especially thankful for when you're trying to move around this 34-pound beast.",

There is nothing of this size, at this price, with this level of performance and quality of components. Remember, as it is often the case, it is all about finding the right balance and this nailed it.",
